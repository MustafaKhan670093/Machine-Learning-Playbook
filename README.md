# The Machine Learning Playbook ðŸ“•

## Introduction

This is a collection of useful code, programs, notes and much more on machine learning. My goal is to practice and demonstrate my understanding of foundational, intermediate and advanced concepts in machine learning by building it all from scratch!

### The Mathematics Behind Neural Networks

To begin with, ["The Mathematics Behind Neural Networks"](https://github.com/MustafaKhan670093/Machine-Learning-Playbook/blob/master/The%20Mathematics%20Behind%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20By%20Mustafa.pdf) outlines my understanding of how NNs work as well as includes a demonstration of taking the foundtional mathematics and programming a NN from scratch in Python.
